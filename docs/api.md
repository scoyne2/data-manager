The below details how the data-manager API functions.

# Running locally
Export required env variables
``export API_HOST=localhost``
``export FRONT_END_URL=localhost``
From the api folder run ``go run main.go``
Access sandbox on your browser via ``http://localhost:8080/sandbox``
As there will not be a database running, expectthat queries will fail with a tcp error.
